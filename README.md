# Saransh Grover

Hey! I'm Saransh. I am a Graduate Student at University of Maryland's Human-Computer Interaction program where I spend my time researching problems and designing solutions for our modern media landscape.

At UMD, I'm a recent addition to the Computational Journalism Lab where I've worked on projects like analyzing misleading headlines for news articles, categorizing COVID-19 fake cure headlines and exploring how to visualize misinformation.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Stony Brook University. I have also been lucky to work at companies like Vyer Technologies, as well as spending a summer with the New York Yankees.
